In the event that the <font color="green">Discloser</font> is unable to obtain a protective order or other appropriate remedy, or if it so directs the <font color="green">Recipient</font>, the <font color="green">Recipient</font> will furnish only that portion of the <font color="green">Confidential Information</font> that the <font color="green">Recipient</font> is advised by written opinion of its counsel is legally required to be furnished by it and will exercise its reasonable best efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such <font color="green">Confidential Information</font>. <ol><li><b>9.

Remedies.</b><br>  Each party’s obligations set forth in this <font color="green">Agreement</font> are necessary and reasonable in order to protect <font color="green">Discloser</font> and its business.  Due to the unique nature of <font color="green">Discloser</font>'s <font color="green">Confidential Information</font>, monetary damages may be inadequate to compensate <font color="green">Discloser</font> for any breach by <font color="green">Recipient</font> of its covenants and agreements set forth in this <font color="green">Agreement</font>.
