i use music as a lens by which to evaluate circumstances in my life and regularly create new playlists to that end.

### [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/14353137) 🏃‍♂️
in high school and college, i ran competitively. after becoming relatively disillusioned with running, i went on a hiatus.however, in 2020, i joined [Raytona Beach Track Club](https://www.instagram.com/raytona_beach/) and started running again without a watch and have recently committed to run a marathon in the spring of 2021. as a result of this, i am planning to start using Strava again more regularly to track key workouts. below are personal bests and (hopefully) an embed code for periodic activity that will show up on Strava.
